## About the app

Mediabin is essentially a [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) clone where, in addition to text, one can post files and images as well. Mediabin was created as a hobby project and is not intended for wide scale use.

Mediabin enables you to share text, files and images easily without having to create an account. By default all posts are public and the 10 latest posts will appear in the "Latest media" list. This can be opted out of by checking the "Hidden" box when uploading. 

There is also a burn after reading function where the media is deleted permanently after it has been opened once.

Text posts can optionally be syntax highlighted with some of the most popular languges being available.
